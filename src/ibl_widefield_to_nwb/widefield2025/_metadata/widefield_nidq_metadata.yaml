  bpod:
    name: "TimeSeriesBpod"
    description: |
      Analog signal from Bpod behavioral control system.
      This continuous voltage signal encodes behavioral state machine events and timestamps from the Bpod system,
      which controls stimulus presentation and reward delivery during tasks.
      The analog encoding allows precise temporal alignment between Bpod events and neural recordings.

  left_camera:
    name: "EventsLeftCamera"
    description: |
      Video frame acquisition times for the left-side camera (body camera).
      Labels: 'exposure_end' = Camera exposure end or frame readout complete;
      'frame_start' = Camera frame acquisition start (frame timestamp).
      Each ON event marks when a video frame was captured by the camera,
      enabling temporal alignment of behavior videos with neural and task data.

    description: |
      Video frame acquisition times for the right-side camera (body camera).
      Labels: 'exposure_end' = Camera exposure end or frame readout complete;
      'frame_start' = Camera frame acquisition start (frame timestamp).
      Each ON event marks when a video frame was captured by the camera,
      enabling temporal alignment of behavior videos with neural and task data.

      Video frame acquisition times for the body camera.
      Labels: 'exposure_end' = Camera exposure end or frame readout complete;
      'frame_start' = Camera frame acquisition start (frame timestamp).
      Each ON event marks when a video frame was captured by the camera,

  imec_sync:
    name: "EventsImecSync"
    description: |
      Multi-probe synchronization signal (1 Hz square wave).
      Labels: 'sync_low' = Sync signal low phase (0.5s duration at 1 Hz);
      'sync_high' = Sync signal high phase (0.5s duration at 1 Hz).
      This signal is simultaneously recorded on NIDQ and all Neuropixels probes (bit 6),
      enabling precise temporal alignment across multiple recording devices.
      The 1 Hz square wave provides regular alignment points for drift correction.

  frame2ttl:
    name: "EventsFrame2ttl"
    description: |
      Monitor refresh events detected by photodiode for visual stimulus timing.
      Labels: 'screen_dark' = Screen transitioned to dark (photodiode detected low luminance);
      'screen_bright' = Screen transitioned to bright (photodiode detected high luminance).
      The Frame2TTL device uses a photodiode to detect changes in screen luminance,
      providing precise timing of when visual stimuli are displayed on the monitor.
      This is essential for accurate stimulus-response latency measurements.

  rotary_encoder_0:
    name: "EventsRotaryEncoder0"

      Rotary encoder pulses tracking wheel movement (quadrature phase A).
      Labels: 'phase_low' = Encoder phase transition to LOW;
      'phase_high' = Encoder phase transition to HIGH.
      Each pulse represents a discrete angular increment of the wheel rotation,
      used to measure behavioral responses and locomotion with high temporal precision.

      0: "phase_low"
      1: "phase_high"
  rotary_encoder_1:
    name: "EventsRotaryEncoder1"

      Rotary encoder pulses tracking wheel movement (quadrature phase B).
      Labels: 'phase_low' = Encoder phase transition to LOW;
      'phase_high' = Encoder phase transition to HIGH.
      Combined with rotary_encoder_0, this provides directional information
      for wheel rotation through quadrature encoding.
